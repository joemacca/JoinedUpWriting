Given a dictionary of words, a starting word and a target word, the program discovers the shortest path in which these two words can be connected.

These 'connections' are based on the letters each word starts and ends with i.e. microphone -> phonenumber -> number etc.

Different rules can be applied to limit how long the words have to be to qualify as a link.
